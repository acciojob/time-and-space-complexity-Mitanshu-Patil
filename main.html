    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph: Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity measures the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of input size. An efficient algorithm has lower time complexity, allowing it to run faster even with large inputs.</p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph: Space Complexity -->
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. For example, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity uses memory proportional to the input size.</p>
